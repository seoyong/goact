# Authorization and authentication

 goAct API utilizes the OAuth2 as authentication protocol. In addition to
standard OAuth2 username/password authentication, backend provides the ability
to authenticate as an application. Authentication information must be sent to
backend within every request, in the Authorization HTTP header.

You must never store  goAct user's username or password in your application.
Instead, you exchange them to the access token, which is used to authenticate
all requests.

## User authentication: Mobile flow

This flow is used in a case where the end user has trusted her password with the
client app. It conforms to OAuth2 specification section
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3

### 1. POST /mint/api/v1/auth/authorize

application/json field | Value
----------|------
grant_type | password
username | _User's username, typically the email address_
password | _User's password_

**Authentication**

No authentication headers are required.

**Example Request**

```sh
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: ApplicationToken 1YotnFZsEjr1zCsicMWpAAFSa" -X POST -d '{"grant_type" : "password", "username":"kc@goact.com.au","password":"xyz"}' https://test.goact.co/mint/api/v1/auth/authorize
```

**Example Response**

```javascript
{ 
    "user" : 1231,
    "access_token" : "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
    "token_type" : "user",
    "redirect_after_login" : "https://test.goact.co/mint/healthTracking.seam",
    "expires_in" : 3600
}
```

Property | Meaning
------|--------  
user | Id of the associated user
access_token | The access token to be used in Authorization header of the requests
token_type | The token type, currently supported type is "user"
redirect_after_login | *Optional* If not missing, the native app should redirect to the url.
expires_in | *Optional* In how many seconds the token expires. If missing, the token is not set to expire.

If the token is already expired, or otherwise cancelled, HTTP 403 error is
returned. In this case, the client application should ask the user to
authenticate again.


**Errors**

Error identifier | HTTP Status | Description
-----------------|-------------|------------
404 | 404 | The requested resource was not found on server 
404 | 404 | The password does not match, suggest reset? 

 

## Checking access token information

### 2. GET /mint/api/v1/auth/:access_token

Get information about the access token used in the request.

**Authentication**

Request must be authenticated by User specific token.

**Example Request**

```sh
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: ApplicationToken 1YotnFZsEjr1zCsicMWpAAFSa" -X GET https://test.goact.co/mint/api/v1/auth/dbd4bc88-7f44-4cd7-b9f6-06db922e36c2
