# General

The API is hosted in address test.goact.co, and all requests require HTTPS
protocol, so each resource address starts with **https://test.goact.co/mint/**.

## Conventions for responses

The following description applies to all URLs in the API. All resources return a
HTTP 200 response code if everything went well, and otherwise an appropriate
error code.

Response data is given in JSON format, unless otherwise noted.


## Conventions for error responses

The following error case descriptions apply for all API URLs.
In case of an error, a non-200 HTTP code is returned along with an error message
and human readable description:

```javascript
{
    "error" : "error_identifier_string",
    "description" : "Human readable description of the error"
}
```

Common error messages are listed in the table below. Error messages specific to
particular resources are described in their own sections.

Error identifier | HTTP Status | Description
-----------------|-------------|------------
not_found               | 404 | The requested resource was not found on server
